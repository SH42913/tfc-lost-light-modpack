TerraFirmaCraft: Lost Light modpack
[CurseForge](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/tfc-lost-light)

When TerraFirmaCraft targets to realistic techs and world presentation, I always miss that exploration courage with structures in vanilla Minecraft. So I want to combine TFC core gameplay and vanilla game feelings in that modpack.

Inspired of TerraFirmaAdventure, but I don't like how compatibility between TFC and other mods is implemented there, I want to make it better.

TerraFirmaCraft used as basement of this modpack: realistic world generation, from stone age to pre-industrial techs.
Stone age improved with Better Stone Age mod.
Medieval age improved with various TFC addons.
Pre-industrial techs improved with Create mod.
Structures are back in TFC world, so now you have reasons to explore this overworld :)
Also Nether is available to reach.
Distant Horizons mod lets you enjoy surroundings from the closest mountain.
On top of that: a lot of QoL and optimization mods.

So, pack your backpack, take your sword and go on to adventures! :)
