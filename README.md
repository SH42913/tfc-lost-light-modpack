TerraFirmaCraft Vanilla+ modpack
[CurseForge](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/tfc-vanilla)

When TFC targets to techs and realistic world presentation, I always miss that exploration courage with structures in vanilla Minecraft.
So I want to combine TFC gameplay and vanilla game feelings in that modpack.

Inspired of TerraFirmaAdventure, but I don't like how compatibility between TFC and other mods is implemented there.
